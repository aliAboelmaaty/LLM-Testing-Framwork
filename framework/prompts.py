Prompt Templates Module

Structured prompt templates following methodology from research papers:
- Dörnbach et al.: 3-part prompts (Problem + Task + Format) for repurposing
- Sonntag et al.: 5-part prompts (Background + Problem + Context + Task + Format) for ML recommendation

This ensures consistent, reproducible prompt engineering across experiments.
